- Life insurance should not be used as an investment vehicle

AVC advisory takes a position against life insurance used as an investment vehicle
because it is costlier, less practical, and riskier than keeping your insurance and savings plans
separate. Cash value, or cash accumulation policies encourage consumers to hold “cash value” in
a savings account that earns interest. This cash value is separate from face amount or death
benefit, and it is attached to whole life and universal life policies. You can borrow against your
cash value and contribute it each month to your funds, eventually hoping that your investment
can to pay off premiums. However, these plans are impractical because they are unnecessarily
costly, there is market risk involved, and consequences to losing the cash or dying before
withdrawing can hurt your beneficiaries.
It is important to understand the categories of cash value insurance for sale as well as
how these products differ to make an informed decision as to why the high premium costs are
not worth the returns. These categories vary in how the cash value component accumulates.
Three major categories of cash value life insurance to consider are whole, universal, and
variable. Whole life insurance covers you for life and the premium is paid in two parts: straight
and cash value. Another cash value insurance option is universal life insurance which consists of
a policy similar to a term policy plus an increased premium directed to a cash account. This cash
account is to earn a specified rate of interest depending on which subcategory you choose:
traditional, interest sensitive, and single-premium. With the traditional method, there is a fixed
premium, a fixed death benefit, and a minimum interest rate. With the interest-sensitive option,
there is also a fixed premium and fixed death benefit, but allows for an increase in death benefits
if return on cash value rise. There is also single premium insurance which consists of a single
premium payment at the time of purchase that provides a death benefit and a cash value account
that grows with investment returns, and is available to be borrowed against. Variable universal
life insurance is very similar to a Universal Life policy except rather than earning a rate of
interest, the cash account can be directed to a variety of investments such as mutual funds .
These aforementioned cash accumulation policies could cost more than four times
comparable term policies.  According to this website’s insurance quote calculator, a healthy,
non-smoking, 40 year old man with a 10 year term policy and a $500,000 face amount, will pay
monthly premiums of $22, and yearly premiums of $254. The same man would pay $670
monthly, or $7,652 yearly for a 120 year whole life policy of the same face amount. While it is
true that cash value will accumulate with the whole life insurance option, it is not worth the cost
because you could be seeing 2% returns after holding on to the policy for 15-20 years. On top of
that, annual investment fees stack up, including a “mortality and expense” charge to assure the
insurance company a profit. In addition to the high cost of these plans, if you would like to
withdraw the cash value in your policy, you will be charged a large cash surrender fee and will
have to pay back the money with interest. If you don’t pay back this “loan”, the amount will be
subtracted from the payout your family will receive after you die. If you die before you withdraw
the cash value in your policy, your insurance company keeps the money. These could severely
hurt your beneficiaries, which is contradictory to the logic of buying life insurance in the first
place. (Especially one with such high premiums!)

Instead of accumulating all of these expenses and lowering returns, you could have a
solid insurance plan and be investing much more strategically in an offshore savings plan which
includes tax reductions, asset protection, and diversification of investment. (Contact AVC for a
free consultation about which offshore savings plan can help you maximize your returns )
Finally, you must consider that there is still a substantial market risk involved with cash
value plans. Many agents trying to sell these policies hide risk to hit sales quotas. If your
accumulation account does not perform well, the cost of insurance and mortality risk charges
could deplete your cash value. You could even find yourself unable to pay your premium and
unable to secure new coverage.
In conclusion, it is highly recommended to steer clear of using life insurance as an
investing vehicle. Instead, take out a cheaper plan that is just as effective and conduct your
investing elsewhere. Doing so will allow you to minimize cost, risk, and ensure that your
beneficiaries are never being deprived of capital.
